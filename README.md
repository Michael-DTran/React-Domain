In this project I will be creating a React App and upload those files to a S3 Bucket to enable website static hosting. Once uploaded I will be making a domain name service under Route 53 (R-53). Once registered I will create a certificate on AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) on a Cloudfront (CF) distribution. Once those are all set up I will then verify that everthing works.
